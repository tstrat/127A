TRAVIS STRATTON

DISCLAIER:  I was a section leader for the university of airzona.  ANY use of these programs which involves submitting a vast majority of the code shown here for school credit is a violation of the adademic integrity policy and in most college level institutions is grounds for failure of the assignment, possibly the course, and potential expulsion.  Plagerism is no joke.

That being said, if you want to view the contents of this folder in search of a specific segment of code to use in a project, feel free.  I do not claim to own this, and it is available for the public to view and to use if its to benifit their project.

-- CONTENTS of this repository ---

In this repo, you will find a folder containing the programs that I was required to do by the University of Arizona's Introduction to Computer Programming course, called 127A (CS1 equivalent).  All the files in that folder are the first programs I ever wrote from scratch, including the very first HelloWorld.java which was my intro into the world of programming.

The other folder, labeled Section Leader demos, is a collection of some of the unique demonstration code that I used for teaching purposes while I held the position of Section Leader for the same 127A intro classes.  I was a SL for 3.5 years and taught classes such as 127A (in JAVA), 335 (CS3/Object Oriented Programming - also in java), and ISTA130 (intro python).

Thanks, and happy programming.
